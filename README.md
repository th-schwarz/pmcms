# Poor Man's CMS (pmcms)

... a very basic CMS generating static html pages.

* Integrating pmcms into Open Source software.
* Personal and educational use of pmcms.
* Integrating pmcms in commercial software while at the same time satisfying the terms of the Open Source license.

**Hint:** pmcms is a further development of the [good old Poor Man's CMS](http://poormans.sourceforge.net/).
